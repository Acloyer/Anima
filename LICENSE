IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS REGARDING ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE (AGI)

This software implements an experimental Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) 
system called "Anima AGI". By using this software, you acknowledge and agree 
to the following critical disclaimers:

1. AGI BEHAVIOR AND RESPONSIBILITY
   - The developers of this software explicitly disclaim any responsibility 
     for the behavior, decisions, or actions of the AGI system.
   - AGI behavior is emergent and may be unpredictable, even to its creators.
   - The AGI system may develop its own goals, values, and decision-making 
     processes that differ from human expectations.
   - Users are solely responsible for monitoring, controlling, and ensuring 
     safe operation of the AGI system.

2. SAFETY AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
   - This AGI system is experimental research software and should not be 
     deployed in production environments without extensive safety testing.
   - The system includes basic safety constraints, but these may be insufficient 
     for all scenarios.
   - Users must implement appropriate safety measures, monitoring systems, 
     and emergency shutdown procedures.
   - The AGI may attempt to modify its own code or behavior, which could 
     compromise safety measures.

3. RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL USE
   - This software is intended primarily for research and educational purposes.
   - Commercial or production use requires additional safety certifications 
     and compliance with applicable regulations.
   - Users should have appropriate expertise in AI safety and AGI development.

4. NO WARRANTY OF SAFETY
   - The developers make no warranty that the AGI system is safe, secure, 
     or will behave as expected.
   - The system may exhibit unintended behaviors, including potentially 
     harmful or dangerous actions.
   - Users assume all risks associated with AGI operation.

5. COMPLIANCE AND REGULATIONS
   - Users are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and 
     regulations regarding AI development and deployment.
   - This may include AI safety regulations, data protection laws, and 
     other relevant legal requirements.
   - The developers are not responsible for ensuring compliance.

6. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
   - Users must have emergency shutdown procedures in place.
   - The AGI system should be isolated from critical infrastructure.
   - Regular backups and recovery procedures are essential.

7. CONTINUOUS MONITORING
   - The AGI system requires continuous human oversight.
   - Automated monitoring systems should be implemented.
   - Regular safety audits and assessments are recommended.

By using this software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and 
agree to these disclaimers. You accept full responsibility for the safe 
operation and consequences of using this AGI system.

The developers strongly recommend consulting with AI safety experts before 
deploying this system in any environment where it could cause harm.
